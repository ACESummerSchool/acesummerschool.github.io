Registration is opened now. Please fill the registration form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSebXDTnNW0-U0-m8mkboRMWV1nBelzp54maBGmoiVkOMXWg2Q/viewform).

There is no fixed deadline for registration. However, **please register on or before 29th January 2023 (23:59 AEDT/GMT+11)** since we only have limited quotas for physical attendance.

The summer school is a **free** event. No registration fee will be charged.

**This year, we will offer a limited number of travel stipends to support non-Melbourne based students who want to participate physically. Please refer to the [travel stipend info page](https://acesummerschool.github.io/stipend/) for more details.**
