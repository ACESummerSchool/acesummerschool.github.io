The 1st Monash-Algorand Centre of Excellence Summer School (ACE Summer School 2023) will be held in Melbourne Australia from 2nd to 3rd Feb, 2023.

The Summer School is an annual event organised by our Algorand Centre of Excellence on Sustainability Informatics for the Pacific (ACE-SIP). The first Summer School will be held from 2nd to 3rd February 2023 at Monash University Clayton Campus, Australia. Over two days, this summer school will feature keynotes by international leaders in the blockchain domain, interspersed with lectures by recognised leaders in the Asia Pacific blockchain and Algorand ecosystem. The summer school will emphasise a friendly environment where students can learn from local and international experts. 

It will be a hybrid event and free to all students around the world to attend, while priority of physical attendance will be given to students coming from the universities within our ACE-SIP (Monash University, Swinburne University of Technology, University of Queensland, University of Sydney, University of Fiji, University of the South Pacific and Hong Kong Polytechnic University).
